# First Ever Website in pure HTML and CSS
---
## Description 
The first ever project under the guidance of Hitesh Chaudhary sir. The overall time took to complete this project was around `12-15 hours`. The duration to complete a single static page is ideally 3-4 hours but I have added an extra efforts to understand the complete concepts such as [CSS Selectors](https://xadai.hashnode.dev/css-selectors-no-confusion-anymore), [CSS Positions](https://xadai.hashnode.dev/css-layout-a-detailed-guide-to-css-positions), and [Basic HTML Tags](https://xadai.hashnode.dev/basic-html-tags-developers-should-know-from-day-1).
